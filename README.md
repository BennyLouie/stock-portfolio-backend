# README

This repository serves as the backend for the Stock Portfolio Webapp.

It primarily acts as a storage for user information, though I have also set fetches for every stock a user owns.

Steps to follow:

1) `bundle` install the gems
2) `rails db:create && rails db:migrate`
3) `rails db:seed`
