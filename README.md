# README

This repository serves as the backend for the Stock Portfolio Webapp.
The frontend can be found here: https://github.com/BennyLouie/stock-portfolio-frontend

It primarily acts as a storage for user information, though I have also set fetches for every stock a user owns.

Steps to follow:

1) `bundle`
2) `rails db:seed`
3) `rails s`
